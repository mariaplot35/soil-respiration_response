#Acclimation of soil respiration to warming

Soil warming increased CO2 emission from soil organic matter over two years, but the longer-term response remains uncertain
It is predicted that an adaptation of the microbial community would cause sustained increases in soil CO 2 emission

We are using a period of paused-warming to test whether the increased soil CO2 emission can be explained by microbial community change
